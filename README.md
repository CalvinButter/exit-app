# Exit app

This is a very simple native module for react-native apps running on the new architecture to force-exit the app.

Probably goes without saying, but you should avoid having to use this module and it should never be a part of your actual user experience. If you're like me right now and need it for internal testing or dev reasons though it's great for that.
